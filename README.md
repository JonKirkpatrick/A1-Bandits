This repository contains the code and documentation for my project.

## Structure

- `docs/`: PDF manual for using my python modules.
- `my_module/`: Python modules for the project.

In the python modules I have written, every function, class and method has been furnished with a docstring
to make their use a little less cumbersome.  The bandit_interface.py file has a little bit of example usage.

## Viewing the Documentation

To view the documentation, download Bandit_Manual.pdf from the 'docs' directory.
