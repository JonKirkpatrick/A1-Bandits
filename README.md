Files associated with assignment 1 for math 4250

This repository contains the code and documentation for my project.

## Structure

- `docs/`: Source files for the Sphinx documentation.
- `docs_html/`: Built HTML files for the Sphinx documentation.
- `my_module/`: Python modules for the project.

In the python modules I have written, every function, class and method has been furnished with a docstring
to make their use a little less cumbersome.  The bandit_interface.py file has a little bit of example usage.

## Viewing the Documentation

To view the Sphinx documentation, pull the whole folder and open the `docs_html/index.html` file in a web browser.
